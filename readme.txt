This application makes an API request to OpenWeatherMap.org. It   
returns the current temperature of the user-entered city. 

This application was created as a learning exercise during my summer 
2020 internship with RBC Wealth Management. This application represents
some of the things I learned during my internship, such as API's, 
how to make API calls, and requests and responses. 

This application was created using Node.js and Express framework.
To run the application, open a terminal and navigate to the project
folder. Enter the following command: node server.js  then press enter.

This project was created with the help of the following website:
