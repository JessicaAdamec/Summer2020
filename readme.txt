This application makes an API request to OpenWeatherMap.org. It   
returns the current temperature of the user-entered city. 

This application was created as a learning exercise during my summer 
2020 internship with RBC Wealth Management. This application represents
some of the things I learned during my internship, such as API's, 
how to make API calls, and requests and responses. 

This project was created with the help of the following website:
